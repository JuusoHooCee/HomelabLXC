A personal homelab built for learning, experimentation and self-hosting. 

This repository documents the setup, configuration, and troubleshooting of my homelab infrastructure — both as a personal knowledge base and as a way to share real-world learning (including failures).

---

## Highlights

- Local AI agent system using Ollama + Open WebUI + n8n
- LLM-powered command execution via workflow automation
- GPU passthrough (GTX 1080) for local AI inference
- Containerized services managed with Docker + Portainer
- Secure remote access using Tailscale VPN
- Real-world debugging of AI reliability and system integration

---

## Why this exists

I built this homelab to move beyond tutorials and actually understand how systems behave in practice — including when they break.

This repository focuses not just on working setups, but also:
- what failed
- why it failed
- how it was fixed

## Architecture Overview

```
Proxmox VE Host
├── VM                  (Debian 12)
│   ├── Ollama          (local LLM inference)
│   ├── Open WebUI      (chat interface)
│   └── n8n             (workflow automation / agent ecexution)
│
└── LXC Container       (docker host)
    ├── Portainer       (container management)
    └── AdGuard Home    (DNS-level ad blocking)

All services accessed via web browser from main PC and mobile via Tailscale VPN
```

## Quick Navigation

- `proxmox/setup.md` — hypervisor setup  
- `debian-vm/` — AI stack and services  
- `lxc-containers/` — containerized infrastructure  
- `network/tailscale.md` — remote access setup  
- `troubleshooting/` — solved issues and fixes

---

## Goals

- Learn Linux, Docker, and self-hosting hands-on
- Build a local AI agent system (Ollama + Open WebUI + n8n)
- Document everything for future reference and to share with others

---

## Status

🟢 Running: Ollama, Open WebUI, n8n, Portainer, AdGuard Home, Tailscale  
🟡 Planned: Active Directory lab, Continue.dev + VSCode   
🔴 Experimental: AI agent workflow (command execution reliability issues)

---

## Notes

This homelab is a learning environment. 
Configuration choices prioritize understanding over best practices — things are done the long way on purpose.
